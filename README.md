 This is a race to reach 50 before your opponent. Player can roll the dice as many times if the 
 score is not one. Player can hold the score to add it to the final score. When the final score is 
 above or equal to 50 the player wins. If the player gets one from the dice then his current run will
 be set to 0 but the total score will not change.
